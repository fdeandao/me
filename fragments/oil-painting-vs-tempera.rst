Before oil paint
became popular, painters used a medium, called tempera, that cannot
be blended or overpainted.  The cost of mistakes was high, and this
tended to make painters conservative.  Then came oil paint, and with 
it a great change in style.  Oil "allows for second thoughts." [3]
This proved a decisive advantage in dealing with difficult subjects
like the human figure.

The new medium did not just make painters' lives easier.  It made
possible a new and more ambitious kind of painting.  Janson writes:

  Without oil, the Flemish Masters' conquest of visible reality
  would have been much more limited.  Thus, from a technical point
  of view, too, they deserve to be called the "fathers of modern
  painting," for oil has been the painter's basic medium ever 
  since.  [4]

As a material, tempera is no less beautiful than oil.  But the
flexibility of oil paint gives greater scope to the imagination--
that was the deciding factor.
