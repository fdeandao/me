Metalinguistic Abstraction
--------------------------

::

        We must constantly turn to new languages in order to express our ideas
        more effectively. Establishing new languages is a powerful strategy for
        controlling complexity in engineering design; we can often enhance our
        ability to deal with a complex problem by adopting a new language that
        enables us to describe (and hence to think about) the problem in a
        different way, using primitives, means of combination, and means of
        abstraction that are particularly well suited to the problem at hand
