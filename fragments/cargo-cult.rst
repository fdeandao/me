CARGO CULT SCIENCE by Richard Feynman
=====================================

::

        But then I began to think, what else is there that we believe? (And
        I thought then about the witch doctors, and how easy it would have
        been to cheek on them by noticing that nothing really worked.) So
        I found things that even more people believe, such as that we have
        some knowledge of how to educate. There are big schools of reading
        methods and mathematics methods, and so forth, but if you notice,
        you'll see the reading scores keep going down--or hardly going up
        in spite of the fact that we continually use these same people to
        improve the methods. There's a witch doctor remedy that doesn't
        work. It ought to be looked into; how do they know that their
        method should work? Another example is how to treat criminals. We
        obviously have made no progress--lots of theory, but no progress--
        in decreasing the amount of crime by the method that we use to
        handle criminals.

cargo cult science definition::

        In the South Seas there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they
        saw airplanes land with lots of good materials, and they want the same
        thing to happen now. So they've arranged to imitate things like
        runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden
        hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head like
        headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas--he's the
        controller--and they wait for the airplanes to land. They're doing
        everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it
        looked before. But it doesn't work. No airplanes land. So I call these
        things cargo cult science, because they follow all the apparent
        precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but they're missing
        something essential, because the planes don't land.
