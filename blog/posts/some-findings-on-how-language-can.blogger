Some findings on how language can affect thinking.<br/><br/>
* Russian speakers, who have more words for light and dark blues, are better able to visually discriminate shades of blue.<br/><br/>
* Some indigenous tribes say north, south, east and west, rather than left and right, and as a consequence have great spatial orientation.<br/><br/>
* The Piraha, whose language eschews number words in favor of terms like few and many, are not able to keep track of exact quantities.<br/><br/>
* In one study, Spanish and Japanese speakers couldn't remember the agents of accidental events as adeptly as English speakers could. Why? In Spanish and Japanese, the agent of causality is dropped: "The vase broke itself," rather than "John broke the vase."<br/><br/><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703467304575383131592767868.html?mod=WSJ_LifeStyle_Lifestyle_5">fuente</a>
