A. Talk to people you respect and ask them what they're doing and what  is interesting. Then read about those topics. When it makes a sense, you  learn a lot more by actually doing a project in an area than by reading  about it.<br/><br/><strong>Q. Time management … technical leaders and executives are famous  for being time-strapped. What strategies do you use to stay sane and  use your time effectively? </strong><br/><br/>
A. Do the things that matter, stop doing the things that don't, and  continuously examine your use of time so that you can tell the  difference. Don't waste time on something just because that's the way it  has been done.<br/><br/><br/>
