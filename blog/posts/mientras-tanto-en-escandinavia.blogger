It has been observed as a form of behaviour for centuries, but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norwegian</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark" title="Denmark">Danish</a> author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aksel_Sandemose" title="Aksel Sandemose">Aksel Sandemose</a> identified it as a series of rules, the Jante Law, in his novel <i><a class="new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_fugitive_crosses_his_tracks&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="A fugitive crosses his tracks (page does not exist)">A fugitive crosses his tracks</a></i> (<i>En flyktning krysser sitt spor</i>,  1933, English translation published in the USA in 1936). Sandemose's  novel portrays the small Danish town Jante (modelled upon his native  town <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyk%C3%B8bing_Mors" title="Nyk&#xF8;bing Mors">Nykøbing Mors</a> as it was at the beginning of the 20th century, but typical of all very small towns), where nobody is anonymous.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jante_Law#cite_note-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><br/>
Generally used colloquially as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology" title="Sociology">sociological</a>  term to negatively describe an attitude towards individuality and  success claimed to be common in Scandinavia, it refers to a supposed  snide, jealous and narrow small-town mentality which refuses to  acknowledge individual effort and places all emphasis on the collective,  while punishing those who stand out as achievers.<br/>
The term may be used by those individuals who feel they are not  allowed to take credit for their achievements, or to point out their  belief that another person is being overly critical.<br/><br/><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Definition">Definition</span></h2>There are ten different rules in the law as defined by Sandemose, but  they all express variations on a single theme and are usually referred  to as a homogeneous unit: <i>Don't think you're anyone special or that you're better than us.</i><br/><b>The ten rules state:</b><br/><ol><li>Don't think that <i>you</i> are special.</li>
<li>Don't think that <i>you</i> are of the same standing as <i>others</i>.</li>
<li>Don't think that <i>you</i> are smarter than <i>others</i>.</li>
<li>Don't fancy <i>yourself</i> as being better than <i>others</i>.</li>
<li>Don't think that <i>you</i> know more than <i>others</i>.</li>
<li>Don't think that <i>you</i> are more important than <i>others</i>.</li>
<li>Don't think that <i>you</i> are good at anything.</li>
<li>Don't laugh at <i>others</i>.</li>
<li>Don't think that any one of <i>us</i> cares about <i>you</i>.</li>
<li>Don't think that <i>you</i> can teach <i>others</i> anything.</li>
</ol>A further rule recognised in the novel is: 11. Don't think that there is anything <i>we</i> don't know about <i>you</i>.<br/>
In the book, those Janters who transgress this unwritten 'law' are  regarded with suspicion and some hostility, as it goes against communal  desire in the town to preserve social stability and uniformity.
