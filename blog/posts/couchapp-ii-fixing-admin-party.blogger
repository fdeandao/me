Everyone is admin. Fix this", click on the link and set the first admin</p><br/><p>I will create the admin as "wariano" and password "secret", whenever you see that change for your user and password</p><br/><p>if we try to push our couchapp again we will get an unauthorized error, that's because we need to provide credentials to modify the database now, to do this we will edit the .couchapprc again to add the user and password</p><br/><p>edit the url from</p><br/><pre>http://localhost:5984/datos
