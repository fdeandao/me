"Programming is the Great Game.  It consumes you, body and soul.  When you're caught up in it, nothing  else matters.  When you emerge into daylight, you might well discover  that you're a hundred pounds overweight, your underwear is older than  the average first grader,  and judging from the number of pizza boxes  lying around, it must be spring  already.  But you don't care,  because your program runs, and the code is fast and clever and tight.  You won.  "<br/><br/>http://www.zoion.com/~erlkonig/writings/programmer-beekeeping.html
