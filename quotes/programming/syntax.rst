programming - syntax quotes
===========================

        The concrete syntax of Standard ML [16] and Haskell [17] are every bit
        as bad as C++. It is a curious measure of the programming language
        community that nobody cares.

        Syntax is not important...

                * unless you're programming
                * or writing tools
