one overriding idea
-------------------

        Btw, it's not just microkernels. Any time you have "one overriding
        idea", and push your idea as a superior ideology, you're going to be
        wrong. Microkernels had one such ideology, there have been others. It's
        all BS. The fact is, reality is complicated, and not amenable to the
        "one large idea" model of problem solving. The only way that problems
        get solved in real life is with a lot of hard work on getting the
        details right. Not by some over-arching ideology that somehow magically
        makes things work.
