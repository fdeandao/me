Don’t work. Be hated. Love someone.
-----------------------------------

        Don’t expect anything. Erase all life expectancies. Just live. Your
        life is over as of today. At this point in time, you have grown as tall
        as you will ever be, you are physically the fittest you will ever be in
        your entire life and you are probably looking the best that you will
        ever look. This is as good as it gets. It is all downhill from here. Or
        up. No one knows.

.

        Do not waste the vast majority of your life doing something you hate so
        that you can spend the small remainder sliver of your life in modest
        comfort. You may never reach that end anyway.
